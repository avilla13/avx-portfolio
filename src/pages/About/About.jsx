        <p>
          I'm a full-stack engineer who is passionate about problem solving. I am transitioning from 7 years of manufacturing engineering where I specialized in custom fabrication. I love knowing how things come together and come apart, whether it's a refrigerated counter or a dynamic user responsive web app. I thrive in a team work-environment because I'm firm believer in communication.
